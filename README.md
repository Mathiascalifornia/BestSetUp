# BestSetUp

This class aims to save time by giving you the best options for a classification or regression problem,
in terms of model, scaler / transformer, preprocessing of categorical data, and if managing outliers is useful or not.
All the results are found using cross validation.
You can also retrieve the preprocessed dataset.
I didn't spend a lot of time on it, so if you find bugs / errors / possible optimization, don't hesitate to contact me by email.
